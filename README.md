# Introduction
First of all, welcome everyone to join 'GeekPie_HPC.' This is a competition team that is technologically neutral and aspires to be on par with Tsinghua. While we value winning and losing, what we emphasize more is everyone's practical ability (proficiency in various tools) and communication skills (being good at brainstorming, taking responsibility, and contributing). If you need to spend the majority of your time boosting your GPA, this club is not for you. Since most of the competitions revolve around mid-term and final exams, we hope for a YOLO (You Only Live Once) spirit.

Regarding how to be a good 'technical sharing officer,' whether in academia or research, value is created while brainstorming with others. The work you do only becomes valuable when it benefits others; otherwise, being a technical expert alone is pointless. We hope that everyone will cherish the opportunity to work with excellent people, see how others do things in the weekly Slack meetings, and then contribute in their own way.

This is the third wiki of 'GeekPie_HPC' hosted on 'github pages,' with some of it in the 'wiki.js' on GeekPie, and a small part on the conference on the GeekPie campus server. In order to avoid the possibility of the server maintenance deleting the data one day, we have put it on GitHub for now.
